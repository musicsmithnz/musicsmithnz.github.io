## <a name="summary"></a> SPINE Web Components

*SPINE Components*. A cli tool for installing SPINE web components and hosting them in a decentralized database. SPINE is an acronym for Storj Polymer IPFS Node Express. It provides the wider framework that includes Polymer components, using Storj and IPFS for database, implemented with Node and Express.

`spinec` is used for adding prebuilt components quickly, as well as customizing and making new components. It uses the [related github polymer_web_components](https://github.com/musicsmithnz/polymer_web_components), a prebuilt component library based on the component libraries [listed here](https://musicsmithnz.github.io/spinec#libraries). The purpose is to speed development, as well as reduce server costs as the resources on this site could be hosted by hundreds or thousands of people at some point in the future through  [IPFS](https://ipfs.io).If a significant number of people use this project, your website resources should load faster as each element will essentially be torrented separately by your peers hosting their own websites with these components.

Made with Polymer3, using the new standard for importing components with ES modules. I plan to make a easy to use cli tool allowing easy import of web components from the component libraries and styling frameworks. For the styling frameworks, I will need to create the components first based on common paradigms and code snippets from official tutorials and examples.
